When you subscribe to Business Standard Premium access, you gain access to opinion pieces, comment and exclusive features specially chosen for you by the Business Standard editors.</p>
<p>The nature of content behind the pay wall is subject to change; the final decision of which lies with the Editor. </p></li>
<li>
<strong><p class="bold">Types of subscription:</p> </strong>
<p>Services may differ from country to country and the device from which you subscribe. Subscriptions packages and price may also vary in time. </p></li>
<li>
<strong><p class="bold">Contract formation: </p></strong><p><strong> </strong>
</p><p>Business Standard will try to process your subscription promptly but does not guarantee that your subscription will be activated by any specified time. By submitting your payment and other subscription details, you are making an offer to us to buy a subscription. Your offer will only be accepted by us and a contract formed when we have successfully verified your payment details and email address, at which point we will provide you with access to your subscription. Business Standard reserves the right to reject any offer in its discretion, for any or no reason.  </p>
<p class="mT15">Business Standard may partner with third party content providers to offer bundled services, under which the payment for both the services will be collected by Business Standard. Business Standard will endeavor to provide a seamless access to all such third parties with a single one point access. There could be a gap in this seamless access due to a technology breakdown, temporary disconnection of the internet connection or any factors beyond the reasonable control of Business Standard. In such cases the contract will be formed once the access to the partner services are restored.</p>
<p class="mT15">You are requested to read through the terms and conditions offered by content partners to Business Standard. Most partners offer bundled services for new users. Existing subscribers of partners are not eligible for bundled subscription. Should you happen to be one please note that the partner will be liable to reject your offer to subscribe under the bundled subscription not leading to contract formation as a result.  </p>

               <li>
               <strong><p class="bold">Payment details: </p> </strong>
               <p class="mT15">When you purchase a subscription, you must provide us with complete and accurate payment information. By submitting payment details you promise that you are entitled to purchase a subscription using those payment details. If we do not receive payment authorization or any authorization is subsequently cancelled, we may immediately terminate or suspend your access to your subscription. In suspicious circumstances we may contact the issuing bank/payment provider and/or law enforcement authorities or other appropriate third parties. If you are entitled to a refund under these terms and conditions we will credit that refund to the card or other payment method you used to submit payment, unless it has expired in which case we will contact you.</p>
<p class="mT15">Business Standard will use the services of quality third party payment service providers to process your payment. Payment options are primarily through credit card. Business Standard may offer other payment mechanisms from time to time.</p></li>

               <strong><p class="bold">Pricing: </p> </strong>
               <p class="mT15">The subscription price will be made clear to you on our sign-up pages or otherwise during the sign-up process and may vary from time to time, by region or by country. You agree to pay the fees at the rates notified to you at the time you purchase your subscription. Subscription to premium services on Business Standard are generally of monthly frequency.
